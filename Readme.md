# More calculations using SQL
In this practice exercise, I use the avocado dataset to perform some calculations using SQL. The calculations I perform are:
* Confirming if the `Total_Bags` column is accurate by summing the `small bags`, `large bags` and `xlarge bags`.
* Calculating the percentages of the `small bags`, `large bags`, `xlarge bags`.
